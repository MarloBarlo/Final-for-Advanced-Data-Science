# A Practical Guide to Regression and Classification in R  
**Author:** Marlon Durand

## Overview

This project explores foundational and advanced topics in data science using R. Through a series of modules and examples, we work with packages such as `caret`, `MASS`, and `ggplot2` to develop regression and classification models. The project includes hands-on modeling using real-world datasets like `diamonds` and `iris`, and covers model evaluation, visualization, and cross-validation techniques.

## Contents

### 1. **Installing and Exploring `caret`**

- Install and load required packages: `caret`, `MASS`, `ggplot2`, `lattice`.
- Explore functions in the `caret` package using `ls("package:caret")`.

### 2. **Linear Regression Modeling**

- Use the `diamonds` dataset to:
  - Build a linear model with `lm()`.
  - Evaluate model performance using RMSE.
  - Use `caret::train()` to perform cross-validated and repeated cross-validated linear regression.

### 3. **Classification Models with `caret`**

- Use the `iris` dataset to:
  - Train a CART classification model with `train(method = "rpart")`.
  - Evaluate model performance using a confusion matrix.
  - Apply cross-validation techniques and examine accuracy and class-based statistics.

### 4. **Feature Plotting with `caret`**

- Visualize features in the `iris` dataset using:
  - Pairwise plots
  - Density plots
  - Box plots  
  These help understand the distribution and relationships between features and classes.

## Key Skills and Concepts

- Linear and logistic regression modeling
- Model evaluation: RMSE, R-squared, MAE, Confusion Matrix
- Cross-validation: 10-fold and repeated
- Data visualization for classification problems
- Feature engineering and predictive analytics using `caret`

## Getting Started

To get started, open your R environment and run the setup blocks to install the required packages and load datasets. Each section is well-commented and modular, allowing you to run and learn as you progress through the code blocks.

## Notes

- This project was developed in an R Notebook format using Org-mode for reproducible research.
- The modeling code is reproducible and modular to support experimentation with different methods or datasets.
